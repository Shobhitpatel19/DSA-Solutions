Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the provided code:
​
- Time complexity:
- The time complexity of the `tryCombination` function depends on the number of valid combinations that sum up to the target `n`. Since each recursive call reduces the problem size by considering a smaller value for `n` and `k`, the time complexity is bounded by the number of valid combinations. The worst-case scenario would be if every recursive call results in a valid combination.
- In each recursive call, we iterate over the numbers from `start` to 9, so there are at most 9 iterations per call.
- Therefore, the time complexity can be expressed as (O(9^k)), where (k\) is the size of the combination (the number of elements in the list).
​
- Space complexity:
- The space complexity primarily arises from the storage of the result list containing all valid combinations. Since the number of valid combinations is bounded by (O(9^k)), where \(k\) is the size of the combination, the space complexity for storing these combinations would be (O(9^k times k)), considering each combination has (k) elements.
- Additionally, we have auxiliary space used for recursion, which is bounded by the depth of the recursion tree, but it's negligible compared to the space used for storing combinations.
- Therefore, the overall space complexity remains (O(9^k times k)).
​
In summary:
- Time complexity: \(O(9^k)\)
- Space complexity: \(O(9^k \times k)\)
​
Here, \(k\) is the number of elements in each combination, and 9 is the upper bound for the numbers we're considering (from 1 to 9).
